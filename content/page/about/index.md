# About Me

Hi, I am Crazyfire Lee (Darren Lee).

A student interested in how machine learning & cyber security can change the world.

I believe that someday the combination of security and machine learning will change the world, and I am working hard to enrich myself in hopes of becoming a small screw that changes the world.

I have a passion for documenting life and sharing knowledge, so I hope to share what I have learned through my blog, or share life~

A place to share life and record some little knowledge.
